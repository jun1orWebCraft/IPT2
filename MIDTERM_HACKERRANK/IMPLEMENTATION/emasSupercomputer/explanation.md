To solve Ema’s Supercomputer, I need to find every possible plus in the grid—these pluses are just 'G' cells that can expand equally in all four directions, like a cross. I checked all the grid’s cells to see the largest plus I could make at each position, then listed out every possible plus with its size and the cells it covered. After that, I compared every pair of pluses to make sure they don’t overlap, and kept track of the highest multiplication of their areas. In the end, the answer is just the biggest product I found.
