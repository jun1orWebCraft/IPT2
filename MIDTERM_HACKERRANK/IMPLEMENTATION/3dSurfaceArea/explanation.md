I start by reading the input and creating the grid. For each cell that has cubes, I consider its top and bottom faces, which always contribute to the surface area. Then, I look around at its neighbors (up/down/left/right). If the neighbor is shorter or missing (edge), that extra surface is visible, so I add that difference. By looping over all cells and summing up these contributions, I calculate the total surface area, and print it out.
