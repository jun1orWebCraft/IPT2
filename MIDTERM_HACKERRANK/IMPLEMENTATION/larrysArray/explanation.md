I solved Larry's Array by realizing that the problem is really about counting how many pairs of numbers are out of order, called inversions. Since the allowed rotation lets us fix these pairs only if the total number of inversions is even, I wrote a function to count all inversions in the array and checked if the count was even or odd. If it was even, I knew the array could be sorted using the allowed moves, so I returned "YES"; otherwise, "NO".
