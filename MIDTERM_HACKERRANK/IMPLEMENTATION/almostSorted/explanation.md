This solution works by first making a sorted copy of the array to see what the array should look like when ordered. It then finds the first and last positions where the original array is different from the sorted one. The code tries swapping these two positions or reversing the segment between them to see if that sorts the whole array. If either operation fixes the order, it prints the action needed; otherwise, it prints "no".
