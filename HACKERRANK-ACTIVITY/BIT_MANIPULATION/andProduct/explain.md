This function efficiently calculates the bitwise AND of all numbers between `a` and `b` by converting them to `BigInt` for large number support, then repeatedly right-shifting both values until they become equal—this removes the differing bits from the lower end. The number of shifts is tracked, and once `a` and `b` match, the result is left-shifted back to restore the original bit length. This works because only the common high-order bits remain unchanged across the entire range, and those determine the final AND result.
