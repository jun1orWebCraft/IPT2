To solve the Highest Value Palindrome problem, my approach was to first make the string a palindrome by comparing each digit from both ends and changing the smaller one to match the larger when needed, recording each change and making sure I didn't use more changes than allowed. Once it was a palindrome, I went through the string again from both ends, spending any leftover changes to turn the digits into '9' wherever possible, making the palindrome as large as I could. If the string has an odd length, I also checked the middle digit and bumped it up to '9' if I still had a change left. This two-step method made sure the result was both a palindrome and the highest value possible with the allowed number of changes.
