This function uses game theory and the Sprague-Grundy theorem. It recursively checks all possible moves (removing one element at a time) and calculates a "Grundy number" for each state. If the current state has a Grundy number of 0, the current player is in a losing position (Bob wins); otherwise, the first player (Alice) can force a win. The isIncreasing function checks if the array is already strictly increasing (which ends the game), and memoization avoids recalculating the same states.
