To solve the Connected Cells in a Grid problem, I looked for groups of 1s that are touching each other — either up, down, left, right, or diagonally. These groups are called regions. I checked every cell in the grid, and when I found a 1, I used a method called depth-first search (DFS) to explore all the connected 1s around it. As I visited each cell, I changed its value to 0 so I wouldn’t count it again. For each region I found, I counted how many cells were in it and kept track of the biggest one. In the end, I returned the size of the largest connected region.
