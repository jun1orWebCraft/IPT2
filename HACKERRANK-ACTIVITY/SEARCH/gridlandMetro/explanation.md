To solve the Gridland Metro problem, I needed to calculate how many cells in a city grid were available for lampposts, given that some cells were already occupied by train tracks. Since the grid can be very large, I used BigInt to safely handle large numbers without overflow. First, I grouped all the track segments by row using a Map, because tracks only affect the row they're on. For each row, I sorted the track intervals and merged any overlapping or adjacent segments to avoid double-counting. I then calculated the total number of occupied cells by summing the lengths of these merged intervals. Finally, I subtracted the total number of occupied cells from the total number of cells in the grid (n × m) to get the number of available spots for lampposts. I returned the result as a string to ensure compatibility with large BigInt values. This approach ensures accuracy and efficiency, even with large inputs and overlapping tracks.
