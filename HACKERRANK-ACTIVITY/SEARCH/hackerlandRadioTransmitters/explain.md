I used a greedy approach by first sorting the house locations to process them in order. Starting from the leftmost house, I found the furthest house within range k and placed a transmitter there. Then I skipped all houses that were covered by that transmitter’s signal, which extends k units to the left and right. I repeated this process until all houses were covered, incrementing the transmitter count each time. This method ensures that each transmitter covers the maximum number of houses possible, minimizing the total number needed.
