o solve the Short Palindrome problem, I needed to count all 4-letter palindromic subsequences of the form a b b a in the string. Instead of checking every possible combination, which would be too slow, I used a counting strategy. I tracked how many times each character appeared (count1), how many 2-letter pairs existed (count2), and how many 3-letter patterns could lead to a valid palindrome (count3). As I looped through the string, I updated these counts and added to the result whenever a valid 4-letter pattern was completed. I used modulo 10^9 + 7 to keep the result within limits. This method is fast and efficient, even for long strings.
