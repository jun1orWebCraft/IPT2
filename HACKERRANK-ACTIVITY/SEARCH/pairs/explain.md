I used a Set to store all the numbers in the array, which allows for constant-time lookups. Then I looped through each number in the array and checked if the number plus the target difference k exists in the Set — meaning there's a valid pair with that exact difference. Every time I found such a match, I incremented the count. This approach avoids nested loops and ensures fast performance even with large inputs, making it ideal for time-sensitive challenges like this one
