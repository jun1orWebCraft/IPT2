I first paired each price with its original year index so I could track the order of transactions. I sorted the prices in ascending order to easily compare close values, but I made sure to only consider pairs where the higher price occurred in an earlier year — meaning the house was bought before it was sold. For each valid pair, I calculated the loss and updated the minimum if it was smaller than the previous one. This approach ensures that I respect the buy-before-sell rule and efficiently find the smallest possible financial loss.
