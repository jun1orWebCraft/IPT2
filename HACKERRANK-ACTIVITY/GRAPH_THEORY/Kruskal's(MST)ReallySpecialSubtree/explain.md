To solve this problem, I used Kruskal’s algorithm to build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). I sorted all edges by weight, and if multiple edges had the same weight, I picked the one with the smallest sum of u + v + weight. Then I added edges one by one, making sure they connect different groups (no cycles) using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU). I added up the weights of the selected edges to get the total cost.
