This solution finds the cheapest way for Jack to travel from station 1 to the last station by modeling the transport network as a graph and using a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm with a custom MinHeap for efficiency. Instead of summing fares like in standard shortest-path problems, it tracks the maximum fare encountered along each path, since Jack only pays the difference at each step. The MinHeap ensures we always process the lowest-cost path first, and the algorithm updates the cost to reach each station only when a cheaper route is found. If the last station is reachable, it prints the minimum cost; otherwise, it prints "NO PATH EXISTS".
