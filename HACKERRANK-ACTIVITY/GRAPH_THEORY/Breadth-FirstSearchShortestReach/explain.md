This function finds the shortest distance from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Each edge has a fixed cost of 6. I built a graph using the edges, then used a queue to explore each node step by step. I marked visited nodes and updated their distance. At the end, I returned the distances to all other nodes, using -1 for unreachable ones.
