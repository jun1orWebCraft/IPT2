To solve this, I build an array A where each element can either be 1 or equal to B[i]. The goal is to maximize the total cost, which is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in A. So I tracked two scenarios at every step: one where I choose A[i] = 1 (low), and one where I choose A[i] = B[i] (high). For each position, I calculated the best possible cost based on the previous choices. It’s like saying: “If I pick 1 here, what’s the best I can get from the last step? And if I pick B[i], what’s the best?” I updated both options step by step, and in the end, I returned the maximum of the two.
