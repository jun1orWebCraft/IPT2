This function calculates how many ways you can make change for amount n using the given coin denominations in array c. I used Dynamic Programming (DP) to build up solutions from smaller amounts. The dp[i] array stores how many ways to make amount i. Starting from dp[0] = 1, I looped through each coin and updated the number of ways to make every amount from that coin up to n. The final answer is dp[n], which tells us how many combinations of coins can make the target amount.
