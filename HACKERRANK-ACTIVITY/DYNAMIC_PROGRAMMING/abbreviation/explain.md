We’re given two strings: a (the messy one) and b (the target). We can capitalize or delete lowercase letters from a, but we can’t change or delete uppercase letters. So I used dynamic programming to track whether it’s possible to match up to each position in a and b. If a character in a matches the one in b (after uppercasing), I moved both pointers. If it’s a lowercase letter, I also tried skipping it. In the end, I checked if we can reach the end of both strings — if yes, return "YES", otherwise "NO".
