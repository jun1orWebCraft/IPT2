We’re given two arrays a and b, and we need to find the longest sequence that appears in both — not necessarily in the same positions, but in the same order. So I used dynamic programming to build a 2D table dp[i][j] that stores the longest common subsequence between a[0..i-1] and b[0..j-1]. If the current elements match, I added that element to the previous sequence. If they don’t match, I picked the longer sequence from either skipping a[i] or b[j]. In the end, dp[a.length][b.length] holds the full longest common subsequence.
