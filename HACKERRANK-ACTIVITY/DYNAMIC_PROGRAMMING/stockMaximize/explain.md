The goal is to buy and sell stocks to get the maximum profit, knowing future prices. So I scanned the prices backward — from the last day to the first — and kept track of the highest price I’ve seen so far (maxFuturePrice). For each day, I imagined buying the stock and selling it later at that highest future price. The difference (maxFuturePrice - prices[i]) is the profit I’d make if I bought on that day. I added up all those profits, and that’s the answer. No need for complex logic — just reverse scan and accumulate gains.
