To make all elements equal, we can only add 1, 2, or 5 chocolates to everyone except one person in each operation. That’s the same as reducing one person’s count by 1, 2, or 5. So I tried to equalize everyone to the smallest value in the array (or slightly below it), and calculated how many steps it takes for each person to reach that target using the fewest operations. I tried targets from min to min - 4 and picked the one with the lowest total steps.
