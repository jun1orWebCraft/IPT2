We’re asked to find two things: the maximum subarray sum (contiguous) and the maximum subsequence sum (non-contiguous). For the subarray part, I used Kadane’s algorithm — I tracked the best sum ending at each position and updated the overall max. For the subsequence part, I just added all positive numbers, since we can pick any non-adjacent values. If all numbers are negative, I picked the largest one. In the end, I returned both values in an array: [maxSubarraySum, maxSubsequenceSum].
