We’re building a wall of size n × m using Lego blocks of width 1 to 4. First, I calculated how many ways we can fill a single row of width m using those blocks. Then, since the wall has n rows, I raised each row’s count to the power of n to get the total combinations. But that includes walls with vertical cracks — which we don’t want. So I used inclusion-exclusion to subtract those cases and keep only the solid walls. Final answer is the number of solid wall formations modulo 1e9 + 7.
