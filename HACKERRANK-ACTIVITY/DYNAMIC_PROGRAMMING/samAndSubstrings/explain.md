We’re given a number as a string, and we need to find the sum of all possible substrings treated as integers. So I looped from the last digit going left, and used a running multiplier to track how many times each digit contributes to the total. For example, the digit 3 in 123 contributes to 3, 23, and 123. I used a variable prev to accumulate the contribution of each digit, and multiplier to scale it properly. I kept everything modulo 1e9 + 7 to avoid overflow. In the end, I returned the total sum of all substrings.
