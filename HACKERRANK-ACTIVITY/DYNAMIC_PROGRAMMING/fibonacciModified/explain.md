This is like Fibonacci, but with a twist: instead of F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), we use F(n) = F(n-2) + (F(n-1))². So I started with t1 and t2, converted them to BigInt to handle large values, and looped from the 3rd term up to n. At each step, I calculated the next term using the modified formula, updated the previous two values, and printed the final result as a string. The key fix is using BigInt for all math and return b at the end — that’s the nth term.
