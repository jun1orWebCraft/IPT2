This function calculates the super digit of a large number formed by repeating string `n`, `k` times, without actually building the huge number. It first sums the digits of `n` using `BigInt` for safety with large values, then multiplies that sum by `k` to simulate the repeated digits. After that, it keeps summing the digits of the result until only one digit remains, which is returned as the final super digit. This approach is efficient and avoids memory issues with massive numbers.
