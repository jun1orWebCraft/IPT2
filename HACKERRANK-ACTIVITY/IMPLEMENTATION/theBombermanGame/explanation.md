To solve the Bomberman Game, I first notice that if n is 1, I should just return the starting grid, and if n is even, the entire grid is filled with bombs. For other cases, the bomb explosions create a repeating pattern every 4 seconds, so I only need to simulate one or two rounds of explosions—first, I simulate what happens after the first set of bombs explodes, and then if needed, simulate a second explosion; based on the remainder of n divided by 4, I pick the correct grid state. This smart use of pattern repetition makes the solution both quick and efficient, without simulating every single second.
