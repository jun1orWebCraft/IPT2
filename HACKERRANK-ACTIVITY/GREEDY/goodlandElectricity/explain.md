I scanned the cities from left to right and tried to place each power plant as far to the right as possible within its range. Each plant can cover up to k - 1 cities on both sides. I only placed a plant if the city was suitable (arr[j] === 1). After placing a plant, I skipped ahead past the cities it covers. If I couldn’t find a valid spot to place a plant, I returned -1. Otherwise, I counted how many plants were needed to cover all cities.
