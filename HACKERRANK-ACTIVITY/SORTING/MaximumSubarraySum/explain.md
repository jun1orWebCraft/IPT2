The `maximumSum` function works by keeping track of prefix sums modulo `m` as it scans through the array, storing each prefix in a sorted list so it can quickly compare the current prefix against earlier ones; whenever it finds a previous prefix that is slightly larger, subtracting it from the current prefix produces a candidate subarray sum that may be bigger modulo `m`, and by updating the maximum each time, the function efficiently computes the largest possible subarray sum modulo `m` without brute force.
