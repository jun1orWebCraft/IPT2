To solve the Full Counting Sort problem, I used an array of 100 buckets to group strings based on their associated integer values. I looped through the input and placed each string into its corresponding bucket, but for the first half of the input, I replaced the string with a dash (-) as required. This ensured the sort remained stable, meaning strings with the same integer kept their original order. After populating the buckets, I flattened them into a single array and printed the result as a space-separated string. This approach leverages counting sort’s efficiency while preserving order and handling the dash replacement rule.
