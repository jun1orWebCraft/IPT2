I used a sliding window approach combined with a frequency array to efficiently track the median of the last d days of expenditures. Instead of sorting the trailing data every time (which would be too slow), I maintained a count of each expenditure value using an array of size 201, since the constraints guarantee values between 0 and 200. For each day starting from d, I calculated the median using the frequency array and checked if the current day's spending was at least twice that median — if so, I incremented the notification count. After each check, I updated the frequency array by removing the oldest value and adding the new one to keep the window moving. This method ensures the solution runs efficiently even for large datasets, and avoids time limit errors by replacing sorting with counting logic.
