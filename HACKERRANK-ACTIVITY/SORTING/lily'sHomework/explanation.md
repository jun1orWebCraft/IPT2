To solve Lily’s Homework, I realized the goal was to find the minimum number of swaps needed to turn the array into its most “beautiful” form — either sorted in ascending or descending order. I created a helper function that counts the number of swaps required to transform the original array into a target sorted version by detecting cycles in the index mapping. For each version (ascending and descending), I calculated the swap count and returned the smaller one. This approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal transformation with minimal swaps, using cycle detection instead of brute-force swapping.
